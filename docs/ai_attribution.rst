AI Assistance Statement
====================

Development Process and AI Tools
-------------------------------

The Hydro-Topo Features package development process incorporated artificial intelligence tools to enhance productivity, code quality, and documentation. In the interest of scientific transparency, we provide the following information about AI usage in this project.

AI Tools Used
------------

* **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**: Assisted with documentation writing, code review, and troubleshooting
* **GitHub Copilot**: Provided code suggestions during development

Areas of AI Assistance
---------------------

AI tools contributed to the following aspects of the project:

1. **Documentation**: Helped format and improve clarity of technical documentation
2. **Code Structure**: Suggested optimizations and best practices
3. **Debugging**: Assisted in diagnosing and resolving technical issues
4. **Testing**: Contributed to development of test cases

Human Oversight
--------------

All AI-generated content underwent careful human review and validation:

* Scientific methodology and algorithms reflect domain expertise and scholarly sources
* Code functionality was independently verified through testing
* Documentation accuracy was confirmed by subject matter experts

We believe this transparent approach to AI usage maintains scientific integrity while leveraging modern development tools.
